# BPG Image format for Ruby

_This is a development version and not for production environments!_

This gem can load JPEG images and return them in BPG format.

For this version of the Gem go to [http://bellard.org/bpg/](http://bellard.org/bpg/)
and install the library on your system. In an other release I want to include the
library as an native extension.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'bpg'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install bpg

## Usage
